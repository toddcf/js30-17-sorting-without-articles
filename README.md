# JavaScript 30 #17: Sorting Without Articles

Sorts items in any array that is passed into it, ignoring (but retaining) any articles such as "a," "an," and "the."

The code defaults to sorting an array of band names, but if you type `sortingMachine.init(movies)` into the console, it will sort an array of movies instead.
